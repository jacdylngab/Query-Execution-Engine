# Query-Execution-Engine
- Designed and implemented a query execution engine in C++ to process database queries using the iterator model.
- Developed core database operators: Select, Project, and Join, each with open(), next(), and close() methods for seamless execution.

  driver.cpp contains predefined test queries. To run a specific query, simply uncomment the corresponding line in the main function.
